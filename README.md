# Traffic Sign Classifier
Designing a neural network for the classification of traffic sign images. 

The complete code can be found in the follwing modules:

- ``utilities.py``: helper functions for the loading, preprocessing and plotting of the data and the 
    investigation results.
- ``model.py``: defintion of a ``Model`` class, making the investigation of several
    network architectures and parameter variations more comfortable.
- ``layers.py``: the layer defintions of the investigated networks. 

## Steps
1. Exploration of the available data set.
2. The basic ``LeNet-5`` network.
3. Investigation of the influence of several parameter variations and architectures on the network's performance.
4. Training and testing of the final network.
5. Predictions on new traffic sign images collected from the internet.

## 1. Exploration of the available data set
The distributions of the training, validation and test data are comparable, however, they are 
far from being uniform. Some classes are present much more frequent then others.

Let's have a look on the traffic sign classes.

The images are of shape 32x32 in RGB color. They were taken under varying light conditions. 
Some can easily be recognized, others are even hard to notice. We will preprocess these images in 
one of the subsequent investigations pipelines.


## 2. The basic ``LeNet-5`` network
![][lenet5]

The ``LeNet-5`` network presented [here][LenetPaper] is used as a starting point for the following
investigations. We will build it by making use of the ``Model`` class defined in ``model.py`` 
and the ``layers`` defined in ``layers.py``. The basic ``LeNet-5`` archictecture is defined as 
follows: 

```python
# layers.py

lenet5_rgb = [
    # in: 32 x 32 x 3
    Conv2d(name="conv1",
           shape=(5, 5, 3, 6),
           strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],
           padding="VALID",
           activation="Relu"),
    # 28 x 28 x 6
    Pool(name="pool1",
         shape=(1, 2, 2, 1),
         strides=(1, 2, 2, 1),
         padding="VALID",
         pooling_type="MAX"),
    # 14 x 14 x 6
    Conv2d(name="conv2",
           shape=(5, 5, 6, 16),
           strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],
           padding="VALID",
           activation="Relu"),
    # 10 x 10 x 16
    Pool(name="pool2",
         shape=(1, 2, 2, 1),
         strides=(1, 2, 2, 1),
         padding="VALID",
         pooling_type="MAX"),
    # 5 x 5 x 16 = 400
    Flatten(size=400),
    # 400
    Dense(name="fc3",
          shape=(400, 120),
          activation="Relu",
          dropout=True),
    # 120
    Dense(name="fc4",
          shape=(120, 84),
          activation="Relu",
          dropout=True),
    # 84
    Dense(name="fc5",
          shape=(84, 43),
          activation=None)]  # out: 43 logits
```

It will take as input an image of shape ``32 x 32 x 3`` and its last layer will output the 
43 traffic traffic sign ``logits``.

The implemented methods of the ``Model`` class allow the building, training and subsequent 
evaluation of the network. Let`s build basic ``LeNet-5`` and train it on the traffic sign 
samples with the folowing first set of parameters:

- **Training Variables Initializer**: Random Normal Initializer (with the defaults: mean=0, stddev=0.1)
- **Dropout**: We will set the dropout in the Dense Layers inactive for the first training
- **Training and Validation Data**: Let's use unprocessed data for the first training
- **Optimizer**: Gradient Descent
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Mini Batch Size**: 128
- **Epochs**: 30

We will vary these parameters in the subsequent analyses to see their effects on the network's performance.

````python
from model import Model
from utilities import Collector, plot_pipeline

# Basic LeNet
tf.reset_default_graph()
lenet = Model('LeNet-5')
lenet.compile(layers=lenet5_rgb,
              initializer='RandomNormal',
              activate_dropout=False)

loss, train_acc, valid_acc = lenet.train(
    train_data=(x_train, y_train),
    valid_data=(x_valid, y_valid),
    optimizer='GradientDescent',
    learning_rate=0.001,
    batch_size=128,
    epochs=30)

collector = Collector()
collector.collect(lenet, loss, train_acc, valid_acc)
plot_pipeline("LeNet-5_Basic", collector)
````

```

![][basic]

It can be seen that the Gradient Descent Optimizer makes a quite slow progress. 
Let's go for the parameter variations.

## 3. Investigation of several parameter effects on the network's performance

#### Optimizers
As the first investigation we will vary the optimizer.

````python
# Parameters
layers = lenet5_rgb
initializer = 'RandomNormal'
optimizers = ['GradientDescent', 'Adam', 'Adagrad']
learning_rate = 0.001
batch_size = 128
epochs = 30

collector = Collector()
for optimizer in optimizers:
    tf.reset_default_graph()
    lenet = Model('LeNet-5')
    lenet.compile(layers=layers,
                  initializer=initializer,
                  activate_dropout=False)
    loss, train_acc, valid_acc = lenet.train(
        train_data=train_data,
        valid_data=valid_data,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        learning_rate=learning_rate,
        epochs=epochs,
        batch_size=batch_size, 
        verbose=1)

    collector.collect(lenet, loss, train_acc, valid_acc)

plot_pipeline("LeNet-5_Optimizer", collector)
````
```
Optimizer = GradientDescent
Epoch 10/30:   Train Loss: 3.6991   Train Acc: 0.0502   Valid Acc: 0.0451
Epoch 20/30:   Train Loss: 3.1851   Train Acc: 0.1845   Valid Acc: 0.1630
Epoch 30/30:   Train Loss: 2.3898   Train Acc: 0.4253   Valid Acc: 0.3859

Optimizer = Adam
Epoch 10/30:   Train Loss: 0.0971   Train Acc: 0.9758   Valid Acc: 0.8585
Epoch 20/30:   Train Loss: 0.0524   Train Acc: 0.9900   Valid Acc: 0.8952
Epoch 30/30:   Train Loss: 0.0303   Train Acc: 0.9864   Valid Acc: 0.8810

Optimizer = Adagrad
Epoch 10/30:   Train Loss: 2.5005   Train Acc: 0.4063   Valid Acc: 0.3422
Epoch 20/30:   Train Loss: 1.8471   Train Acc: 0.5405   Valid Acc: 0.4605
Epoch 30/30:   Train Loss: 1.4762   Train Acc: 0.6237   Valid Acc: 0.5317
```

![][optimizer]

The ``Adam`` optimizer seems to make a pretty good job. We will use it as the default optimizer for the rest of 
the project. 

#### Input Data Normalization
Next let`s preprocess the input data. The function ``preprocess`` from ``utilities.py`` does this job for us. 
It performs scaling and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization ([CLAHE][Clahe]) on the input images.

````python
def preprocess(x, scale='std', clahe=True):
    """ Preprocess the input features.

    Args:
        x:
            batch of input images
        clahe:
            perform a contrast limited histogram equalization before scaling
        scale:
            'normalize' the data into a range of 0 and 1 or 'standardize' the
            data to zero mean and standard deviation 1

    Returns:
        The preprocessed input features, eventually reduced to single channel
    """

    if clahe is True:
        x = np.array([np.expand_dims(rgb2clahe(img), 2) for img in x])

    x = np.float32(x)

    if scale is not None and scale.lower() in ['norm', 'normalize']:
        x /= x.max()
    elif scale is not None and scale.lower() in ['std', 'standardize']:
        mean, std = x.mean(), x.std()
        x = (x - mean) / (std + np.finfo(float).eps)

    return x
````

The output on the class samples shown above looks as follows:
![][preprocessing]

We can see that the edges and the content of the signs get highlighted independently of the 
lightning situation in the original images. Let's investigate the effect of each of the preprocessing 
parameters on the performance of the network. Since the output of the CLAHE operation is a gray image, 
we will introduce ``lenet5_single_channel`` layers that can handle single channel input images. 
All other layer parameters stay the same.

![][normalization]

If the input images are both standardized and pass the CLAHE operation, the network seems 
to show the best performance. We will keep this as the default image preprocessing pipeline.

Well, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference which of the shown initializers we use.
We'll keep the ``TruncatedNormal`` Initializer as standard for the following analyses.


#### Learning Rates
One of the most important parameters is the learning rate of the optimizer. Let's have a look.

A learning rate that is too big, leads to no learning at all. It seems that a learning rate of ``0.001`` 
makes a good starting choice. We will keep this rate for the rest of the project.

The smaller the batch size, the slower the learning. In this case, it doesn't seem to have that much of 
an influence on the performance. We will stay with a batch size of 128, since it allows us a little bit 
faster training.


#### Dropout
Next, let's finally activate the dropout layers. As we can see above, dropout layers are 
introduced in the 3rd and 4th Dense layer of the ``Lenet-5`` network. We will activate them 
and have a look on the influence of the ``keep_prob`` probability.

A drop out rate of 50% gives us the best results. We'll set it as default for the rest of the project.

more learning parameters. Let's see if it is worth.

![][convdepth] 

The network seems to benefit from the extended depth. However, the increase in performance is bought 
by an explosion of paramaters that need to be trained. We will stay with the basic convolution depth, 
since it shows a good performance with a fraction of parameters.


#### Addational Convolution layer
Let us investigate if an addtional 3rd convolution layer gives us a better compromise between parameter 
and performance increase. The new layers are defined in ``layers.py``. 
The difference of the ``lenet6a_layers`` and ``lenet6b_layers`` is the convolution filter (``5x5`` vs ``3x3``) 
and the convolution depth (``400`` vs ``50``). They were chosen in a way that a comparable amount of parameters 
are flattened before entering the Dense layers.

````python
# lenet6a_layers 
...
# 5 x 5 x 16

The ``Lenet-5`` network still shows a better performance with fewer parameters. 


#### Concatenating Layers
Lastly we will have a look on the effect of concatenating layers as shown in [this paper][LecunPaper]. 
The output of the 2nd and 3rd convolutional layers are concatenated and led into the Dense layer for
classification.
![][lecun]

In this investigation we will use the LeNet-6a and LeNet-6b networks shown above to perform 
this kind of concatenation. We will have a look on following variants.  

Concatenation of the outputs of
- the 2nd and 3rd convolutional layers
- the 2nd pooling and 3rd convolutional layer

As always the layer defintions can be found in ``layers.py``.

benefit in performance. 


## 4. Training and testing of the final network.
Since the investigated architectures did not show a benefit over the ``LeNet-5`` network, 
we will use the latter with the adjusted parameters shown in the previous sections for the final 
training and testing. The final training will be performed for 50 epochs. 

````python
# Parameters
initializer = 'TruncatedNormal'
optimizer = 'Adam'
learning_rate = 0.001
keep_prob = 0.5
batch_size = 128
epochs = 50

tf.reset_default_graph()
lenet = Model('LeNet-5_Final')
lenet.compile(layers=lenet5_single_channel,
              initializer=initializer,
              activate_dropout=True)

loss, train_acc, valid_acc = lenet.train(
    train_data=(preprocess(x_train), y_train),
    valid_data=(preprocess(x_valid), y_valid),
    optimizer=optimizer,
    learning_rate=learning_rate,
    keep_prob=keep_prob,
    epochs=epochs,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    save=True)

collector = Collector()
collector.collect(lenet, loss, train_acc, valid_acc)
plot_pipeline("LeNet-5_Final", collector)
````

#### Evaluation of the test set
````python
tf.reset_default_graph()
with tf.Session(config=config) as session:
    lenet = Model()
    lenet.restore(checkpoint="models/LeNet-5_Final.ckpt-47")
    acc = lenet.evaluate(preprocess(x_test), y_test)
    print(f"Accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
````
````
Accuracy: 0.9583
````

The evalution of the unseen test set leads to an accuracy of **95.83%**.

## 5. Predictions on new traffic sign images collected from the internet.
Now let's see how the network performs on traffic sign images gathered from in the internet. 

![][newimages]

````python
# Predict new test images
tf.reset_default_graph()
with tf.Session(config=config) as session:
    lenet = Model()
    lenet.restore(checkpoint="models/LeNet-5_Final.ckpt-57")
    acc = lenet.evaluate(preprocess(x_test_new), y_test_new)
    print(f"\nAccuracy on new test signs: {acc * 100:.2f}%\n")            
    top_k_probs, top_k_preds = lenet.predict( preprocess(x_test_new), k=3)

plot_predictions(x_test_new, y_test_new, top_k_probs, top_k_preds, sign_names)
````
````
Accuracy on new test signs: 70.45%
````
The accuracy is quite low compared to the original test set, since some of the images were chosen to be edge cases 
and to challenge the network.

##Observations and improvements:
- In some cases the network is able to correctly predict partly occluded or polluted signs.
- The network does a good job if the signs are centered, viewed from the front and do fill a major part of the area.
- It has its problems with signs that are located outside of the center, viewed from a perspective or are far away.
- The latter problem could be reduced by extending the training data with augmented data.
- As can be seen by the miss prediction of the traffic signals sign, the network could enventually benefit from color 
  information. The pipeline chosen in this project uses a colorless input. Seeing only gray the traffic lights 
  share great similarity with the general caution sign.
- The last two stop signs were taken from the paper ["Robust Physical-World Attacks on Deep Learning Visual 
  Classification"][Attack] which handles the vulnerablity of neural networks to small-magnitude perturbations 
  added to the input. The network poorly falls on one of these examples.
- Although the network shows its uncertainty with the unknown images, a plausibility check using additional 
  available information could lead to a greater robustness of the predictions.
